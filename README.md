## How to run

-   Install dependencies: `yarn install`

-   Build the app `yarn run build`

-   Serve the app locally `yarn run serve` (Alternatively `yarn run dev` for both). The serve command currently uses `miniserve`, but it could be any web server

## Local dev

-   `yarn install`
-   Open two terminal windows:
    -   `yarn run sass-watch`
    -   `yarn run dev`
-   Sass will now be automatically compiled
