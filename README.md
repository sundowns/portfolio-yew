## How to run

-   Install dependencies: `yarn install`

-   Build the app `yarn run build`

-   Serve the app locally `yarn run serve` (Alternatively `yarn run dev` for both). The serve command currently uses `miniserve`, but it could be any web server

## Local dev

-   `yarn install`
-   Open two terminal windows:
    -   `yarn run sass-watch`
    -   `yarn run dev`
-   Sass will now be automatically compiled

### Website design goal

-   Some kind of top banner (name, contacts, links to socials (itch, github, twitter, linkedin)). Include the monkey.
-   Single page you scroll through, tabs at the top just scroll to content (if tabs are needed at all, probably not in current scope)
-   Hero section for current game (takes up most if not all of page as as you scroll to it). A hero video (trailer eventually) and maybe a carousel of short dev clips from twitter/gyazo.
-   Should be possible to provide a URL that scrolls straight to hero game section.
-   Maybe a tiny section on game jam projects (like 1 liner on each). Good example: https://joebrogers.com/
-   Some kind of very brief footer (maybe just social links again)
